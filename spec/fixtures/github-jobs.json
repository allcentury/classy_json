A CS background or degree usually helps a lot, but is not a strict requirement if you really know your stuff.</p>\n\n<h2>Our Tech </h2>\n\n<p>At our core, we are a team of great engineers from world-class companies, so we take our tech very seriously. We work to improve our tools and approaches every day -- whether pushing the envelope with automated unit-tests or writing a super-optimized data analysis framework. We don&#39;t over-engineer and also don&#39;t under-engineer -- just the right tool for the job.</p>\n\n<p>We take great pride in our code because we all want to innovate quickly. We build everything from Android software to C++ image recognition, from web UI to pedometer data analysis. Our apps operate off-line, and we have built lots of client-side infrastructure to lazily load and sync data with the server. This allows us to keep the server side relatively simple while still serving millions of users: Spring/Flask, Spring MVC, mySQL/Mongo.</p>\n\n<p>We run Hadoop-based machine learning to find out what makes people stick to habits, create online clustering algorithms to match people to their ideal support group, serve millions of users with many terabytes of data, and tackle many difficult challenges ( <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Noom-company/What-are-some-of-the-engineering-challenges-at-Noom\">http://www.quora.com/Noom-company/What-are-some-of-the-engineering-challenges-at-Noom</a> ) every day. Because we are small dev team (17 strong), working at Noom gives you the unique opportunity to both use what we have created and build many more foundational technologies.</p>\n\n<h2>Our Culture </h2>\n\n<p>We have worked hard to build an awesome company culture ( <a href=\"http://www.noom.com/culture.php\">http://www.noom.com/culture.php</a> ), stealing a bit from Google (many of us are ex-Googlers) and improving on it to become one of Crain\u2019s \u201cBest Places to Work in NYC 2013\u201d ( <a href=\"http://www.crainsnewyork.com/gallery/20131206/FEATURES/120909999/64\">http://www.crainsnewyork.com/gallery/20131206/FEATURES/120909999/64</a> )</p>\n\n<p>Our tech team works with a ton of interesting Noomers and advisers, including our in-house psychologist as well as fitness experts, physicians and researchers. We test our prototypes on sample users, averaging 2 user-tests a day, so you\u2019ll be able to see how real people react to your work and iterate. So unlike most tech companies, you\u2019ll interact with a diverse network of people. After all, we are team of problem solvers, always interested in learning and growing.</p>\n\n<p>If you\u2019re worried about being pigeonholed, fear not. You\u2019ll get to choose a mission (usually for 4 - 6 months) and work on the projects you\u2019re interested in. We also have frequent company-wide hackathons. Everyone on the team is a generalist -- we explore new frameworks, and learn them quickly. We like to learn.</p>\n\n<p>We are now ready to double the size of our engineering team with some incredible engineers (read on below!).</p>\n\n<h2>Our Company </h2>\n\n<p>Noom is a New York-based health &amp; wellness tech startup that uses mobile technology to help people lead healthier lives (22 million and counting!). While other fitness companies just track, we coach. We learn from the best research in nutrition, psychology and behavior modification and combine it with the latest tech to design next-generation health &amp; wellness apps on Android and iOS.</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve built a strong foundation with hundreds of thousands of paying customers, a grant from the National Institutes of Health, $7M in Series A funding led by RRE Ventures and a team of 40 full-time Noomers -- 30 in our NYC headquarters and 10 in our foreign offices (Seoul and Berlin).</p>\n\n<p>But we need your help -- read on if you think you\u2019ve got the stuff.</p>\n\n<h2>Our Products </h2>\n\n<p>At Noom we tackle some of the world\u2019s biggest problems -- obesity, diabetes and heart disease. We believe the best way to do this is by focusing on nutrition (TechCrunch ( <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/22/health-startup-noom-receives-nih-grant-to-study-smartphone-tech-in-eating-disorder-treatment/\">http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/22/health-startup-noom-receives-nih-grant-to-study-smartphone-tech-in-eating-disorder-treatment/</a> )) and fitness (GigaOm ( <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2013/06/11/nooms-android-fitness-app-another-example-of-why-smartphones-are-the-original-wearable-computers/\">http://gigaom.com/2013/06/11/nooms-android-fitness-app-another-example-of-why-smartphones-are-the-original-wearable-computers/</a> )). More than just counting calories, our mobile software applications offer intelligent, scientifically-backed, customized nutrition- and exercise-coaching designed to impact habits and behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Our flagship app, Noom Weight Loss Coach, has been the #1 top grossing health &amp; fitness application since 2012. It achieves the best outcomes in the industry with over 10 pounds lost per paid member. How, you ask? Great question! It has:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A coaching engine that generates personalized daily tasks &amp; realtime motivational feedback;</p></li>\n<li><p>The world\u2019s most accurate food database, crowd-sourced by users &amp; instantly searchable;</p></li>\n<li><p>Virtual support groups created using automated clustering technology and tracked using scalable management tools.</p></li>\n<li><p>A focus on simplicity and friendliness, to make all of the above easy to use</p></li>\n<li><p>Many more features focused around guidance &amp; motivation for our users</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Our Benefits </h2>\n\n<p>If you want to learn how a startup really works on the inside, then Noom is the place for you. We have an incredible amount of transparency, with weekly all-company TGIFs where the wine and the information both flow freely (much to our legal counsel\u2019s dismay). Because you\u2019ll have equity in the company and have to make many decisions in your work, it\u2019s important for you to know what\u2019s going on.</p>\n\n<p>We have an amazing chef (we love her!) who prepares gourmet lunches every day for all employees (along with afternoon smoothies and random breakfasts and dinners), a lively office with frequent visitors, and a dedicated team who work hard and play hard, with frequent offsites (beach, anyone?) and team outings (from shuffleboard to wine tasting). We also have more cakes than is probably healthy (welcome cakes, birthday cakes, goodbye cakes and cakes just because -- no joke).</p>\n\n<p>Plus health insurance (100% paid by Noom) and a 401(k).
